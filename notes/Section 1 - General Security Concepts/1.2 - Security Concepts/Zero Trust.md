# Zero Trust

---

## What is Zero Trust?

Zero Trust is a security model based on the principle of **"Never trust, always verify."** It assumes that threats exist both inside and outside the network, so no user or device is trusted by default.

---

## Core Principles

- **Verify explicitly**: Always authenticate and authorize based on all available data points.
- **Least privilege access**: Limit user and device access to only what is necessary.
- **Assume breach**: Design systems as if an attacker is already inside the network.

## Key Components

| Component                | Description                                    |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Identity Verification    | Strong multi-factor authentication (MFA)       |
| Device Security          | Ensure devices meet security standards          |
| Network Segmentation     | Divide network to contain breaches              |
| Continuous Monitoring    | Real-time analysis of user and device behavior  |
| Microsegmentation        | Fine-grained access controls on network traffic |

---

## Implementation Strategies

- Implement **strict access controls** for users and devices.
- Use **encryption** everywhere.
- Monitor and log **all network activity**.
- Regularly update and patch systems.
- Apply **dynamic policies** based on risk.

---

## Benefits

- Reduces risk of insider threats and lateral movement.
- Improves visibility and control over resources.
- Enhances compliance with regulations.

---

## Summary

Zero Trust challenges traditional perimeter-based security by requiring verification and least privilege at every access request, regardless of user location or device.
