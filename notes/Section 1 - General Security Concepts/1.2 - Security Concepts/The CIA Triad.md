# The CIA Triad



---

## Overview

The **CIA Triad** is a foundational concept in cybersecurity. It outlines three core principles used to guide policies for information security.

## The Three Pillars

| Principle         | Description                                                                 | Example Use Cases                          |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Confidentiality** | Ensures data is only accessible to authorized users.                         | Encryption, access controls, VPNs          |
| **Integrity**       | Ensures data is not altered or tampered with without detection.              | Hashing, digital signatures, checksums     |
| **Availability**    | Ensures systems and data are accessible when needed by authorized users.     | Redundancy, backups, load balancing        |

---

## Key Points

- **Confidentiality** breaches expose sensitive data (e.g., PII, credentials).
- **Integrity** breaches modify data maliciously or accidentally (e.g., altered logs).
- **Availability** breaches cause downtime (e.g., DDoS attacks, hardware failures).

## Common Tools and Technologies

| Principle         | Common Implementations                          |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Confidentiality   | Encryption (AES, TLS), access control lists     |
| Integrity         | File checksums, digital signatures, hashing     |
| Availability      | RAID, cloud backups, UPS, clustering            |

## Summary

The CIA Triad defines the **goals of a secure system**:
- Keep data secret (**Confidentiality**)
- Keep data accurate (**Integrity**)
- Keep data accessible (**Availability**)

Understanding and applying these principles is critical to designing and evaluating any secure system.
