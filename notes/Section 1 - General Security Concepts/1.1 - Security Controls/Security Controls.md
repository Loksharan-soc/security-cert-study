## What Are Security Controls?

Security controls are safeguards or countermeasures implemented to reduce risk, enforce security policies, and ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) of information systems.

## Types of Security Controls

| Category           | Description                             | Examples                                         |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Managerial         | High-level administrative mechanisms    | Security policies, risk assessments, training    |
| Operational        | Day-to-day procedures by personnel      | Incident response, physical access, awareness    |
| Technical          | Implemented through technology          | Firewalls, encryption, antivirus, access control |

## Functional Types of Controls

| Type              | Purpose                                  | Examples                                          |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Preventive        | Stop incidents before they occur         | Firewalls, security training, locks               |
| Detective         | Identify incidents during/after occurrence| IDS, logs, security cameras                       |
| Corrective        | Fix or mitigate after an incident        | Patching, backups, system restoration             |
| Deterrent         | Discourage attacks or misuse             | Warning signs, policy enforcement, security guards|
| Compensating      | Alternative when primary control isn't feasible | Logging when MFA can't be implemented     |

## Key Takeaways

- **Managerial controls**: Policy and decision-level enforcement.
- **Operational controls**: Human-driven security processes.
- **Technical controls**: Automated or system-based mechanisms.

- **Preventive controls**: Proactive measures.
- **Detective controls**: Monitoring and detection.
- **Corrective controls**: Response and recovery.
- **Deterrent controls**: Discouragement mechanisms.
- **Compensating controls**: Workarounds that meet intent of original control.

## Summary

Understanding both the category and function of security controls helps build a comprehensive security posture. Effective security implementations often layer multiple types and functions of controls to achieve defense in depth.
