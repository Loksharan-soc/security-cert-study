## Types of Encryption

| Type               | Description                             | Examples                         |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Symmetric Encryption | Same key used for encryption/decryption | AES, DES, 3DES                 |
| Asymmetric Encryption| Uses public/private key pairs           | RSA, ECC                      |

## Common Encryption Algorithms

- **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)**: Widely used symmetric cipher, strong and efficient.
- **DES/3DES**: Older symmetric ciphers, less secure today.
- **RSA**: Popular asymmetric encryption for key exchange and signatures.
- **ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography)**: Efficient asymmetric encryption with smaller keys.
- **Blowfish, Twofish**: Symmetric block ciphers.

## Encryption Modes

- **Block cipher modes**: CBC (Cipher Block Chaining), GCM (Galois/Counter Mode), ECB (Electronic Codebook).
- **Stream ciphers**: Encrypt data one bit or byte at a time (e.g., RC4).

## Key Management

- Secure generation, distribution, storage, and rotation of keys is essential.
- Poor key management can compromise encryption effectiveness.

---

## Applications

- Data at rest encryption (disk encryption, databases).
- Data in transit encryption (TLS/SSL, VPNs).
- Digital signatures and authentication.

---

## Summary

Encryption technologies use various algorithms and modes to secure data confidentiality and integrity. Effective key management and algorithm choice are critical for security.
