# Obfuscation

---

## What is Obfuscation?

Obfuscation is the process of making code, data, or communication difficult to understand or interpret, with the goal of hiding its true purpose or content from unauthorized users.

---

## Purpose

- Protect intellectual property (e.g., source code).
- Prevent reverse engineering or tampering.
- Hide sensitive data or communication patterns.

---

## Common Techniques

| Technique               | Description                                  |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Code Obfuscation        | Renaming variables, control flow alteration |
| Data Obfuscation        | Encoding or encrypting data                   |
| Protocol Obfuscation    | Altering communication patterns               |

---

## Use Cases

- Protecting software from piracy or hacking.
- Concealing malware behavior.
- Securing sensitive information in transit.

---

## Limitations

- Obfuscation does not provide strong security; it only raises the difficulty for attackers.
- Determined attackers with enough resources may still reverse engineer or decode obfuscated content.

---

## Summary

Obfuscation is a supplementary security technique aimed at making data or code harder to analyze or exploit, but it should not be relied on as the primary security control.
