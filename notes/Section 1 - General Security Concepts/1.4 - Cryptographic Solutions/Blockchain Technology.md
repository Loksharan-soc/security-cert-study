## What is Blockchain?

Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that records transactions across multiple computers in a way that ensures security, transparency, and immutability.

---

## Key Features

- **Decentralization**: No single authority controls the data.
- **Immutability**: Once recorded, data cannot be altered without consensus.
- **Transparency**: Transactions are visible to participants.
- **Consensus Mechanisms**: Methods to agree on data validity (e.g., Proof of Work, Proof of Stake).

---

## How Blockchain Works

- Transactions are grouped into **blocks**.
- Each block contains a cryptographic **hash** of the previous block.
- Blocks are linked together forming a **chain**.
- Changes require altering all subsequent blocks, which is computationally infeasible.

---

## Use Cases

- Cryptocurrencies (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum).
- Supply chain management.
- Secure voting systems.
- Identity management.

---

## Summary

Blockchain technology provides a secure, tamper-resistant way to record and share data across distributed systems, enhancing trust without relying on a central authority.
