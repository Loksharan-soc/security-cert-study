# Encrypting Data

---

## What is Data Encryption?

Encryption is the process of converting readable data (plaintext) into an unreadable format (ciphertext) to protect confidentiality.

## Types of Encryption

| Type               | Description                                 | Example Algorithms                   |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Symmetric Encryption | Uses the same key for encryption and decryption | AES, DES, 3DES                     |
| Asymmetric Encryption| Uses a key pair: public key to encrypt, private key to decrypt | RSA, ECC                          |

## Symmetric Encryption

- Fast and efficient.
- Requires secure key distribution.
- Commonly used for bulk data encryption.

---

## Asymmetric Encryption

- Used for key exchange, digital signatures.
- Slower than symmetric.
- Enables secure communication without sharing secret keys in advance.

---

## Encryption Modes

- Block cipher modes (CBC, GCM, ECB).
- Stream ciphers (RC4).

---

## Key Management

- Proper key generation, storage, and rotation are critical.
- Keys must remain confidential.

---

## Use Cases

- Protecting data at rest (files, databases).
- Protecting data in transit (VPNs, TLS).
- Secure email and messaging.

---

## Summary

Encrypting data ensures confidentiality by making information unreadable to unauthorized users, relying on strong algorithms and effective key management.
