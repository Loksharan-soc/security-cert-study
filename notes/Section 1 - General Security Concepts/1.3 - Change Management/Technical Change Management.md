## What is Technical Change Management?

Technical Change Management focuses on the specific processes and controls involved in implementing changes to IT systems from a technical perspective.

---

## Key Aspects

- Detailed **planning and documentation** of technical changes.
- Coordination with development, operations, and security teams.
- **Impact analysis** on system performance, security, and availability.
- Ensuring **rollback plans** and backups are in place.

## Process Steps

| Step               | Description                                      |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Identify Change    | Define the technical change and its requirements |
| Impact Assessment  | Analyze effects on systems and users             |
| Design and Test   | Develop and validate the change in test environments |
| Implementation    | Deploy changes according to schedule and plan     |
| Monitoring        | Observe the system post-change for issues         |
| Rollback          | Execute rollback if problems occur                |

## Best Practices

- Use **version control** for configuration and code changes.
- Automate deployments where possible to reduce errors.
- Communicate clearly with all stakeholders.
- Maintain detailed logs and audit trails.

---

## Benefits

- Reduces risk of technical failures.
- Improves system stability and reliability.
- Enhances security through controlled changes.
