## Key Components

| Component             | Description                                            |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS)** | Provides short-term backup power during outages.             |
| **Generators**        | Provide long-term power during extended outages.        |
| **Power Distribution Units (PDU)** | Manage and distribute power efficiently within data centers. |
| **Surge Protectors**  | Protect equipment from voltage spikes and surges.       |
| **Redundant Power Supplies** | Multiple power inputs to critical devices to ensure continuous operation. |

## Best Practices

- Implement UPS systems for critical infrastructure to allow graceful shutdowns.
- Use generators for backup power during prolonged outages.
- Regularly maintain and test power equipment.
- Monitor power quality and usage.
- Design redundant power paths to eliminate single points of failure.
