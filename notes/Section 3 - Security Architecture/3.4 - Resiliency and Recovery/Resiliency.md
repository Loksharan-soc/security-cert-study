# Resiliency

## Overview

Resiliency refers to an organization's ability to **prepare for, respond to, and recover from disruptive events** while maintaining continuous business operations and minimizing downtime.

## Key Concepts

| Term                 | Description                                                |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Fault Tolerance**  | Systems designed to continue operation despite failures.   |
| **Redundancy**       | Duplication of critical components or systems.             |
| **Failover**         | Automatic switching to a standby system during failure.    |
| **Disaster Recovery** | Processes to restore systems and data after a major event. |
| **Business Continuity** | Ensures essential functions continue during disruptions. |

## Strategies for Resiliency

- Implement **redundant hardware** (servers, power supplies).
- Use **clustering** and **load balancing** to distribute workloads.
- Maintain **offsite backups** and disaster recovery plans.
- Conduct **regular testing** of failover and recovery procedures.
- Use **geographic diversity** for critical infrastructure.

---

## Measuring Resiliency

- **Recovery Time Objective (RTO):** Maximum acceptable downtime.
- **Recovery Point Objective (RPO):** Maximum tolerable data loss.

---

## Benefits

- Minimizes financial and operational impact of disruptions.
- Increases customer trust and regulatory compliance.
- Supports rapid recovery from cyberattacks or natural disasters.

---

## Summary

Resiliency is a vital aspect of security architecture, focusing on ensuring systems and processes can withstand and quickly recover from failures or attacks.
