# Secure Infrastructures

## Overview

A secure infrastructure is the foundation of any cybersecurity posture. It includes the secure design, implementation, and maintenance of hardware, software, and networks. The goal is to reduce the attack surface and enforce layered security.

## Key Concepts

| Concept                     | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Defense in Depth**       | Layered security strategy using multiple controls at different levels.     |
| **Least Privilege**        | Users and systems have only the access necessary to perform their roles.   |
| **Separation of Duties**   | No single person has complete control over a critical process.             |
| **Redundancy**             | Duplicate systems/components to maintain availability during failure.      |
| **Fail Secure**            | Systems default to a secure state in case of failure (e.g., lock doors).   |

## Secure Design Principles

- **Secure by Design**: Security is integrated into the architecture from the start.
- **Minimization**: Only essential services and software are installed.
- **Default Deny**: Access is denied unless explicitly allowed.
- **Scalability**: Infrastructure should scale securely as demand grows.
- **Monitoring and Auditing**: Constant visibility into operations and changes.

## Examples

- Using **firewalls**, **IDS/IPS**, and **network segmentation** for traffic control.
- Enforcing **multi-factor authentication (MFA)** on critical systems.
- Regularly **patching** systems and decommissioning legacy services.
- Implementing **role-based access control (RBAC)** in enterprise environments.

## Summary

Building a secure infrastructure is about intentional architecture, proactive control implementation, and ongoing maintenance. It supports the organizationâ€™s ability to prevent, detect, and respond to threats.
