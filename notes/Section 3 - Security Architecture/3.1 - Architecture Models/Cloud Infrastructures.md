# Cloud Infrastructures

---

Cloud infrastructure refers to the hardware and software components — such as servers, storage, networking, virtualization, and management tools — that support the delivery of cloud computing.

## Cloud Deployment Models

| Model           | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Public Cloud** | Services offered over the public internet by third-party providers (e.g., AWS, Azure). |
| **Private Cloud**| Exclusive cloud environment operated solely for one organization.         |
| **Hybrid Cloud** | Combines public and private clouds, allowing data and applications to move between them. |
| **Community Cloud** | Shared infrastructure between organizations with common concerns (e.g., compliance). |

## Key Components

| Component           | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Compute**          | Virtual machines (VMs), containers, serverless functions.                  |
| **Storage**          | Object, block, and file storage services.                                  |
| **Networking**       | Virtual networks, firewalls, load balancers, and VPNs.                     |
| **Virtualization**   | Abstraction layer that enables multiple OS instances on the same hardware. |
| **Management Tools** | Interfaces and APIs to manage, monitor, and provision cloud resources.     |

## Cloud Service Models

| Model         | Responsibility Split                | Example Services                    |
|---------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **IaaS** (Infrastructure as a Service) | Provider manages hardware; user manages OS and apps | AWS EC2, Azure VMs |
| **PaaS** (Platform as a Service)      | Provider manages runtime, OS, and infrastructure    | Google App Engine, Azure App Services |
| **SaaS** (Software as a Service)      | Provider manages everything                          | Google Workspace, Microsoft 365 |

## Security Considerations

| Area                 | Security Measures                                                    |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Data Protection**   | Encrypt data at rest and in transit; use strong access controls.     |
| **Access Control**    | Implement IAM (Identity and Access Management); least privilege.     |
| **Isolation**         | Ensure tenant separation in multi-tenant environments.               |
| **Logging & Monitoring** | Enable auditing, logging, and alerts.                             |
| **Compliance**        | Align with regulatory standards like HIPAA, GDPR, PCI-DSS.           |
| **Shared Responsibility Model** | Understand which components the cloud provider secures and which you secure. |

## Advantages of Cloud Infrastructure

- Scalability and elasticity
- Cost efficiency (pay-as-you-go)
- High availability and fault tolerance
- Faster deployment and provisioning
- Global reach and accessibility

---

## Summary

- Cloud infrastructure supports computing via IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS models.
- Security and management depend on deployment and service models.
- Understand the shared responsibility model to properly secure cloud assets.
