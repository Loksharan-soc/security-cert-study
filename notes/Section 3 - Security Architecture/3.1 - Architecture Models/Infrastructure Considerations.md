# Infrastructure Considerations

---

Understanding infrastructure considerations is essential for designing, implementing, and maintaining secure and efficient systems.

---

## Redundancy and High Availability (HA)

- **Redundancy**: Duplication of critical components or functions to increase reliability.
- **High Availability**: System design that ensures continuous operation, even during failures.

**Examples:**
- RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks)
- Dual power supplies
- Server clustering
- Load balancing

---

## Scalability

- Ability to grow or shrink resources to meet demand.
- Types:
  - **Vertical Scaling**: Add more power (CPU/RAM) to existing systems.
  - **Horizontal Scaling**: Add more systems (nodes).

**Security Consideration:** Ensure security controls scale with the environment (e.g., access controls, logging).

---

## Elasticity

- Automatic allocation and deallocation of resources based on load.
- Common in **cloud environments**.
- Cost-effective and efficient but requires:
  - Auto-scaling policies
  - Monitoring
  - Resource tagging and usage control

---

## Resiliency

- Ability of a system to **recover from disruptions** and maintain operations.
- Related to redundancy and disaster recovery planning.

**Components:**
- Backups and restores
- Fault tolerance
- Failover strategies
- Business Continuity Planning (BCP)

---

## Resource Constraints

- Considerations around limited:
  - CPU and memory
  - Storage capacity
  - Bandwidth
  - Power

**Security Tip:** Avoid overloading systems to reduce vulnerabilities and prevent outages.

---

## Performance and Latency

- **Performance**: Speed and efficiency of a system.
- **Latency**: Delay between request and response.
- Optimize by:
  - Caching
  - Reducing network hops
  - Choosing appropriate infrastructure

---

## Security Zoning

- Segmentation of infrastructure based on security needs.
- Use **DMZs**, **internal zones**, and **restricted zones**.
- Enforce different access control and monitoring levels in each zone.

---

## Network Segmentation

- Dividing a network into smaller subnets.
- Helps with:
  - Traffic isolation
  - Limiting attack surface
  - Containing breaches

---

## Logical vs Physical Segmentation

| Segmentation Type | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| **Logical**        | Uses VLANs, subnets, firewalls |
| **Physical**       | Separate hardware and cabling |

---

## Summary

Infrastructure considerations are the foundation of a secure IT environment. Effective infrastructure:
- Ensures availability and performance
- Reduces risk through redundancy and segmentation
- Supports business continuity through resiliency
- Must align with both technical and business goals
