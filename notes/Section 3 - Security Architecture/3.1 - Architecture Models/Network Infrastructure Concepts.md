# Network Infrastructure Concepts

---

Network infrastructure refers to the hardware and software resources that enable network connectivity, communication, operations, and management within an organization.

## Key Network Components

| Component         | Description                                                                            |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Router**        | Connects different networks and forwards data packets between them.                   |
| **Switch**        | Connects devices within the same network and forwards data based on MAC addresses.    |
| **Firewall**      | Monitors and controls incoming/outgoing network traffic based on security rules.      |
| **Access Point**  | Provides wireless connectivity to wired networks.                                     |
| **Modem**         | Converts digital data to analog (and vice versa) for transmission over phone lines.   |
| **Gateway**       | Acts as a translator between different network protocols.                             |

## Network Topologies

| Topology  | Description                                                |
|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Bus**    | All devices share a single communication line.             |
| **Star**   | Devices connect to a central hub or switch.                |
| **Ring**   | Devices form a circular data path.                         |
| **Mesh**   | Each device connects to every other device.                |
| **Hybrid** | Combines two or more different topologies.                 |

## IP Addressing and Subnetting

- **IPv4**: 32-bit addressing scheme (e.g., 192.168.1.1)
- **IPv6**: 128-bit addressing scheme for future scalability.
- **Subnetting**: Divides a large network into smaller, more manageable segments.

---

## VLANs (Virtual LANs)

- Logically segments a network into different broadcast domains.
- Enhances performance and security by isolating traffic.

---

## DMZ (Demilitarized Zone)

- A physical or logical subnetwork that contains and exposes external-facing services.
- Adds a buffer between the internal network and external threats.

---

## NAT (Network Address Translation)

- Maps private IP addresses to a public one to access the internet.
- Helps conserve public IP addresses and adds a layer of security.

---

## VPN (Virtual Private Network)

- Creates a secure encrypted connection over an insecure network like the internet.
- Commonly used for remote access and site-to-site connections.

---

## Network Segmentation

- Divides a network into smaller segments to reduce attack surfaces.
- Limits lateral movement during a breach.

---

## Summary

- Network infrastructure includes routers, switches, firewalls, and access points.
- Logical tools like VLANs, NAT, and VPNs help secure and manage traffic.
- Topologies, segmentation, and addressing schemes form the foundation of secure, scalable networks.
