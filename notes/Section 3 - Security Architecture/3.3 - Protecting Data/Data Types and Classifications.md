## Common Data Types

| Data Type           | Description                                            |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **Structured Data** | Organized in fixed fields (e.g., databases, spreadsheets). |
| **Unstructured Data** | No predefined format (e.g., emails, documents, multimedia). |
| **Semi-structured Data** | Has some organizational properties (e.g., XML, JSON).    |
| **Sensitive Data**  | Data that requires protection due to privacy or regulatory requirements. |

## Data Classification Levels

| Classification Level | Description                                            | Example                                   |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Public**           | Information intended for public disclosure.            | Marketing materials, press releases.      |
| **Internal**         | Information intended for internal use only.            | Internal policies, employee contact lists.|
| **Confidential**     | Sensitive data requiring restricted access.            | Customer data, financial records.          |
| **Restricted**       | Highly sensitive data with strict access controls.     | Trade secrets, health records, passwords. |

## Purpose of Data Classification

- Apply appropriate **security controls** (encryption, access restrictions).
- Support **regulatory compliance** (GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS).
- Facilitate **data handling policies** (retention, disposal).
- Identify data for **risk management**.

---

## Labeling and Handling

- Data should be **labeled clearly** with its classification.
- Handling procedures depend on classification (e.g., encryption for confidential data).
- Training and awareness for staff on handling classified data.

## Summary

Classifying data according to its sensitivity ensures that organizations protect valuable information appropriately, comply with laws, and reduce the risk of data breaches.
