# Protecting Data

## Overview

Protecting data is a critical component of cybersecurity that involves safeguarding data throughout its lifecycle, regardless of its state. Effective data protection prevents unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.

## Key Concepts in Data Protection

| Concept                  | Description                                                     |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Data Classification**  | Categorizing data based on sensitivity to apply proper controls.|
| **Data Encryption**      | Encoding data to prevent unauthorized access.                   |
| **Access Controls**      | Restricting who can view or modify data.                        |
| **Data Masking**         | Obscuring sensitive data to protect privacy.                    |
| **Data Loss Prevention (DLP)** | Tools and policies to prevent unauthorized data exfiltration. |
| **Backup and Recovery**  | Regularly copying data to restore after loss or corruption.     |

## Encryption Techniques

- **At Rest:** Use full disk encryption, database encryption, and file-level encryption.
- **In Transit:** Use TLS/SSL, VPNs, and secure protocols like SSH.
- **In Use:** Protect memory and application processes, though encryption here is more complex.

---

## Access Controls

- Implement **least privilege** and **role-based access control (RBAC)**.
- Use **multi-factor authentication (MFA)**.
- Regularly audit and review access permissions.

---

## Data Masking and Tokenization

- **Data Masking:** Hides original data with modified content (useful in testing).
- **Tokenization:** Replaces sensitive data with non-sensitive placeholders.

---

## Data Loss Prevention (DLP)

- Monitors data movement and usage.
- Enforces policies to prevent unauthorized copying or transmission.
- Can be network-based, endpoint-based, or cloud-based.

---

## Backup and Recovery

- Regular backups with secure storage.
- Test recovery procedures periodically.
- Ensure backups are protected with encryption and access controls.

---

## Physical Security

- Protect servers, storage devices, and backup media from theft or damage.
- Use locked facilities, surveillance, and environmental controls.

## Summary

Comprehensive data protection combines classification, encryption, access control, masking, DLP, backups, and physical security. These layered defenses ensure data confidentiality, integrity, and availability throughout its lifecycle.
