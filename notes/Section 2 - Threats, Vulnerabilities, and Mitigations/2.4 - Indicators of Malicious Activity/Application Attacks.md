# Application Attacks

---

Application attacks target vulnerabilities in software applications, often exploiting poor coding practices, weak authentication, or improper input handling. These attacks can lead to data breaches, service disruption, or unauthorized access.

## Common Types of Application Attacks

| Attack Type                | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Injection Attacks**      | Insert malicious code (e.g., SQL, LDAP, Command) into a programâ€™s input.    |
| **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** | Injects malicious scripts into web pages viewed by users.            |
| **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)** | Forces authenticated users to execute unwanted actions.     |
| **Insecure Deserialization** | Exploits deserialization routines to run arbitrary code.               |
| **Directory Traversal**    | Gains access to files/directories outside of the intended scope.           |
| **Buffer Overflows**       | Overwrites memory, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.        |
| **Race Conditions**        | Exploits timing to change system behavior or gain access.                  |
| **Logic Flaws**            | Abuses intended application logic to bypass controls or escalate privileges. |

## Injection Attack Focus

| Injection Type     | Example Scenario                                                |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **SQL Injection**  | `' OR '1'='1` in a login form to bypass authentication.          |
| **Command Injection** | `; rm -rf /` embedded in input to run OS-level commands.       |
| **XML Injection**  | Inserts malicious XML content into SOAP/XML documents.          |

---

## Key Attack Vectors

- **User Input Fields:** Forms, search bars, login pages.
- **File Uploads:** Unrestricted uploads can lead to remote code execution.
- **APIs and Webhooks:** Improper validation can expose backend logic.
- **Session Management:** Poor token handling may allow session hijacking.

## Prevention Techniques

| Technique                     | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Input Validation**          | Enforce strict checks on all user input.                                   |
| **Parameterized Queries**     | Use prepared statements to avoid SQL injection.                            |
| **Output Encoding**           | Sanitize output to prevent script execution.                               |
| **Authentication/Authorization** | Ensure proper identity verification and role checks.                  |
| **Secure Session Management** | Implement token expiration, rotation, and protection.                      |
| **Error Handling**            | Avoid detailed error messages that reveal app structure.                   |
| **Patch Management**          | Regularly update frameworks and dependencies.                              |

## Secure Development Practices

- **Use security-focused frameworks and libraries**
- **Conduct code reviews and static analysis**
- **Perform penetration testing**
- **Follow secure SDLC principles (DevSecOps)**

## Summary

- Application attacks are diverse and often caused by insecure coding or improper input handling.
- Common attacks include injection, XSS, CSRF, and logic flaws.
- Preventive measures involve secure coding practices, robust validation, and regular security testing.
