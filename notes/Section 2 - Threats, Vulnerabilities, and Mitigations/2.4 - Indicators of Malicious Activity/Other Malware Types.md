# Other Malware Types

---

This section covers various types of malware beyond viruses, worms, and spyware. These malware types are commonly tested on the Security+ exam and often seen in real-world cybersecurity incidents.

---

## üß† Trojans

### Definition:
A **Trojan** (or Trojan horse) disguises itself as legitimate software to trick users into installing it. Once active, it performs malicious actions without the user's consent.

### Behavior:
- Appears to be useful (e.g., fake installers, cracked software)
- Opens backdoors, installs additional malware, or steals data
- Often bypasses traditional antivirus because it's user-installed

### Mitigation:
- Use application whitelisting
- Only download software from trusted sources
- Educate users on social engineering traps

## üõ†Ô∏è Remote Access Trojans (RATs)

### Definition:
A **Remote Access Trojan** is a type of Trojan that gives attackers full control over an infected system remotely.

### Capabilities:
- Webcam/microphone control
- File exfiltration or destruction
- Keylogging and command execution

### Detection:
- Unusual outbound network traffic
- Unexpected system behavior or resource usage

---

## üí£ Logic Bombs

### Definition:
A **logic bomb** is code embedded within another program that executes when specific conditions are met (e.g., a date, user action, or event).

### Example Triggers:
- Employee termination
- File deletion or access
- Specific time or date

### Characteristics:
- Hidden and dormant until triggered
- Common in insider attacks

---

## üï≥Ô∏è Backdoors

### Definition:
A **backdoor** bypasses normal authentication or access controls, allowing unauthorized remote access.

### Types:
- Intentional (e.g., for troubleshooting during development)
- Malicious (installed by attackers or malware)

### Detection/Mitigation:
- Conduct regular system and application audits
- Use file integrity monitoring
- Block unknown outbound connections

---

## üëæ Rootkits

### Definition:
A **rootkit** is software designed to hide the presence of malware or attackers by modifying the operating system or installing at a low level.

### Characteristics:
- Kernel-level or firmware-level access
- Hides files, processes, or registry keys
- Difficult to detect and remove

### Detection:
- Rootkit detectors (specialized scanning tools)
- Boot from clean media to scan
- Monitor for hidden or inconsistent system behavior

---

## üëª Fileless Malware

### Definition:
**Fileless malware** operates in-memory without writing files to disk, making it harder to detect with traditional antivirus.

### Examples:
- PowerShell or WMI scripts
- Registry-based persistence
- Living-off-the-land (LotL) techniques using native OS tools

### Prevention:
- Disable unnecessary scripting engines
- Use behavior-based detection
- Monitor memory and process activity

| Logic Bomb          | Trigger-based attack               | Insider sabotage                    |
| Backdoor            | Authentication bypass              | Persistent access                   |
| Rootkit             | Hides malware/system activity      | Long-term, stealthy compromise      |
| Fileless Malware    | No disk presence                   | Evasion of traditional AV tools     |

## Defensive Measures

- Enable EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response)
- Use least privilege and application control
- Conduct frequent system audits and baselines
- Educate users about suspicious downloads and scripts
