# Malicious Code

---

**Malicious Code** refers to any software intentionally designed to cause damage, steal data, or disrupt operations. It includes a wide range of threats such as viruses, worms, Trojans, and scripts.

## Common Types of Malicious Code

| Type              | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Virus**         | Attaches to legitimate files or programs and requires user interaction to spread. |
| **Worm**          | Self-replicates and spreads without user action, often across networks.     |
| **Trojan Horse**  | Disguised as legitimate software but performs harmful actions.              |
| **Ransomware**    | Encrypts files and demands a ransom for decryption.                         |
| **Spyware**       | Secretly monitors user activity and sends data to a third party.            |
| **Adware**        | Displays unwanted ads and may come bundled with spyware.                    |
| **Logic Bomb**    | Executes malicious action when certain conditions are met.                  |
| **Rootkit**       | Hides its presence and allows privileged access to systems.                 |

## Infection and Propagation Methods

| Method                  | Explanation                                                            |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Phishing Emails**     | Deliver infected attachments or links to malicious websites.           |
| **Drive-by Downloads**  | Automatically downloads malware when visiting compromised websites.    |
| **Removable Media**     | USB drives or other media used to transfer malicious files.            |
| **Exploiting Vulnerabilities** | Uses software bugs or misconfigurations to gain access.         |

## Detection and Prevention

| Strategy                     | Description                                                       |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Antivirus/Anti-malware**   | Scans and removes known malicious code signatures.                |
| **Application Whitelisting**| Only approved applications are allowed to run.                     |
| **Patch Management**         | Regular updates reduce the chance of exploiting known vulnerabilities. |
| **User Training**            | Educating users to recognize suspicious links, emails, and behavior. |
| **Network Segmentation**     | Limits the spread of malware between systems.                     |

## Key Concepts

- Malicious code is often hidden inside seemingly harmless software.
- It can be **triggered by events**, **automatically executed**, or **manually activated**.
- Effective defense requires **layers of protection**: user awareness, endpoint security, system hardening.

---

## Summary

- Malicious code comes in many forms and targets systems, data, and users.
- Prevention includes secure configurations, up-to-date software, and defensive tools.
- Awareness and monitoring are critical to minimizing damage and responding to threats.
