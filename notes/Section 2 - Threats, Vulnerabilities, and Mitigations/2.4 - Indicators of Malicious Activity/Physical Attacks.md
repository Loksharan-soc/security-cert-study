# Physical Attacks

---

Physical attacks target hardware and devices directly, often bypassing digital security controls. These attacks require physical access to a system or infrastructure.

## Types of Physical Attacks

| Attack Type             | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **USB-based attacks**   | Malicious USB devices used to inject malware, steal data, or execute code. |
| **Drive-by data theft** | Physically accessing a device to copy sensitive data (e.g., laptops, phones). |
| **Skimming**            | Devices attached to card readers (e.g., ATMs) to steal card data.          |
| **Shoulder surfing**    | Observing someone enter sensitive information (e.g., passwords, PINs).     |
| **Dumpster diving**     | Retrieving discarded documents or hardware that contain confidential data. |
| **Eavesdropping**       | Listening to conversations or using devices to intercept audio/video.      |
| **Hardware keyloggers** | Physical devices attached to keyboards to log keystrokes.                  |

## Common Vectors

- **Unattended devices** (e.g., workstations, USB ports)
- **Public or shared environments** (e.g., libraries, cafes)
- **Insecure facilities** with poor access controls

## Mitigation Strategies

| Strategy                          | Purpose                                                        |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Disable unused physical ports    | Prevents USB-based attacks                                     |
| Use port locks or USB blockers   | Physically blocks USB or other I/O ports                       |
| Physical access control systems  | Restrict and log entry to secure areas                         |
| Employee awareness training      | Helps staff recognize and avoid physical attack vectors        |
| Shred or destroy sensitive data  | Prevents data recovery from disposed materials or hardware     |
| Surveillance systems             | Deter and detect unauthorized physical access                  |

## Real-World Example

A rogue USB drive left in a parking lot may tempt employees to plug it into a corporate machine, launching malware or opening a reverse shell.

---

## Summary

- Physical attacks often exploit human error or weak access control.
- They can bypass logical security measures.
- Preventative strategies must combine user education with physical controls and monitoring.
