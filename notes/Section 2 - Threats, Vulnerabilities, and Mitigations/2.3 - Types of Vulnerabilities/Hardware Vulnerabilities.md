# Hardware Vulnerabilities

---

## Overview

**Hardware vulnerabilities** refer to flaws or weaknesses in physical components that can be exploited to compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of a system. These vulnerabilities can exist in CPUs, memory, firmware, or peripheral devices.

## Common Types of Hardware Vulnerabilities

| Type                        | Description |
|-----------------------------|-------------|
| **Firmware Vulnerabilities**| Bugs or backdoors in the low-level code that runs on hardware (e.g., BIOS/UEFI). |
| **Side-channel Attacks**    | Exploit indirect information (e.g., timing, power usage, electromagnetic leaks). |
| **Physical Attacks**        | Require physical access, e.g., inserting malicious devices or extracting chips. |
| **Supply Chain Attacks**    | Hardware is tampered with during manufacturing or shipping. |
| **Processor Exploits**      | Exploits like Spectre and Meltdown target CPU speculative execution flaws. |

## Examples

- **Spectre & Meltdown**: Exploit CPU-level flaws to read memory contents across privilege boundaries.
- **BadUSB**: Reprogramming USB firmware to act as a malicious input device or deliver malware.
- **Evil Maid Attack**: Attacker with physical access tampers with bootloader or firmware.
- **Cold Boot Attack**: Extracting data from RAM after power-off using freezing techniques.

## Impacts

- Unauthorized data access  
- Privilege escalation  
- Persistence of malware in firmware  
- Device control takeover  
- Difficulty in detection and remediation

---

## Prevention and Mitigation

- **Firmware Updates**  
  - Regularly patch BIOS/UEFI and device firmware.
- **Trusted Supply Chain**  
  - Use vetted vendors and verify device integrity.
- **Physical Security Controls**  
  - Restrict access to sensitive systems and components.
- **Hardware Security Features**  
  - Use Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs), Secure Boot, and hardware-based encryption.
- **Security Audits and Testing**  
  - Perform regular checks and penetration testing focused on hardware-level issues.

## Summary

Hardware vulnerabilities pose unique challenges due to their low-level nature and persistence. They require proactive prevention, supply chain integrity, and secure physical and firmware practices to mitigate risk.
