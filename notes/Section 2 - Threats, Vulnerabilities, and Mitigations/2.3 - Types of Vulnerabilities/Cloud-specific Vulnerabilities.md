# Cloud-specific Vulnerabilities

---

## Overview

Cloud-specific vulnerabilities are security weaknesses unique to cloud environments. These arise due to the shared, on-demand, and scalable nature of cloud computing and the abstraction of infrastructure from end-users.

## Common Cloud-specific Vulnerabilities

| Vulnerability                     | Description |
|----------------------------------|-------------|
| **Misconfigured Cloud Storage**  | Publicly exposed storage buckets or permissions. |
| **Insecure APIs**                | Poorly secured or undocumented APIs used for cloud management. |
| **Account Hijacking**            | Compromised credentials grant unauthorized access to cloud resources. |
| **Insufficient Identity Management** | Lack of multi-factor authentication (MFA) or poor IAM policies. |
| **Vendor Lock-in**               | Difficulty in migrating or securing data due to reliance on a single provider. |
| **Data Breaches**                | Sensitive data accessed or leaked due to insecure configurations or shared infrastructure. |
| **Shadow IT**                    | Unauthorized or unmanaged cloud services used without IT oversight. |

## Cloud Deployment Models

| Model          | Vulnerability Considerations |
|----------------|------------------------------|
| **Public Cloud** | Shared infrastructure, greater risk of multi-tenant exploitation. |
| **Private Cloud** | More control, but still vulnerable to misconfigurations. |
| **Hybrid Cloud** | Complexity in managing consistent security policies across environments. |

## Risks in the Cloud

- Loss of visibility and control  
- Data leakage across tenants  
- Unauthorized resource usage  
- Inadequate logging and monitoring  
- Legal/regulatory compliance issues  

---

## Mitigation Strategies

- **Use Strong IAM**: Enforce least privilege access, enable MFA.
- **Secure APIs**: Use authentication, rate limiting, and encryption.
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Implement logging, alerts, and audits for all cloud activities.
- **Encrypt Data**: Encrypt data at rest and in transit using strong standards.
- **Security Posture Management**: Regularly assess and remediate misconfigurations (e.g., using CSPM tools).

## Summary

Cloud-specific vulnerabilities stem from the abstraction and complexity of cloud environments. Securing these systems requires proper configuration, identity controls, and continuous monitoring tailored to cloud platforms.
