# Impersonation

## What is Impersonation?

Impersonation is a **social engineering technique** where an attacker pretends to be someone else—typically a trusted figure—to gain unauthorized access to information, systems, or facilities.

## Common Impersonation Targets

| Role Impersonated     | Reason |
|------------------------|--------|
| **IT Support**         | Victims may follow tech-related instructions without questioning. |
| **Executive/Manager**  | Creates urgency or pressure for employees to act quickly. |
| **Vendor/Contractor**  | Easier to request access or services without scrutiny. |
| **Law Enforcement**    | Exploits fear or respect for authority. |

## Techniques Used

- **Name Dropping**: Refers to real people in the organization to appear legitimate.
- **Urgency or Authority**: Uses power dynamics or urgent requests to bypass normal procedures.
- **Knowledge of Internal Systems**: May study the organization to mimic language and processes.
- **Pretexting**: Builds a fabricated backstory to establish credibility.
- **Tailgating/Piggybacking**: Following authorized personnel into secure areas.

## Scenarios

- Calling the help desk pretending to be an employee needing a password reset.
- Dressing like a delivery person to gain physical access to a building.
- Sending emails from spoofed executive accounts requesting sensitive data.

---

## Prevention and Defense

- **Security Awareness Training**: Teach staff how to recognize and challenge unusual requests.
- **Verification Procedures**: Always confirm identities through secondary channels.
- **Strict Access Controls**: Enforce least privilege and monitor access attempts.
- **Visitor Policies**: Require identification and escorting in secure areas.
- **Report Suspicious Behavior**: Encourage employees to report anything unusual.

## Summary

Impersonation exploits human trust and social norms. Reducing its success depends on user vigilance, strong policies, and consistent verification procedures.
