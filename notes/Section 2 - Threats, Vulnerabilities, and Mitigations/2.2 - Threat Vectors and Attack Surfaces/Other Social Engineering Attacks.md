# Other Social Engineering Attacks

---

## Overview

Social engineering attacks manipulate human behavior to bypass security controls. Beyond common attacks like phishing and impersonation, there are several other techniques used to deceive victims.

## Types of Social Engineering Attacks

| Attack Type           | Description |
|------------------------|-------------|
| **Shoulder Surfing**   | Observing someoneâ€™s screen or keyboard to capture sensitive information like passwords or PINs. |
| **Dumpster Diving**    | Retrieving discarded documents or hardware to gain access to confidential data. |
| **Tailgating**         | Physically following an authorized person into a restricted area without credentials. |
| **Pretexting**         | Creating a fabricated scenario to obtain information (e.g., posing as HR to get employee data). |
| **Quid Pro Quo**       | Offering a service or benefit in exchange for information or access (e.g., free software or tech help). |

## Real-World Examples

- **Tailgating**: An attacker follows an employee through a secure door by pretending to have forgotten their badge.
- **Dumpster Diving**: Collecting shredded but poorly destroyed documents to reconstruct sensitive information.
- **Pretexting**: Calling a help desk while pretending to be a senior executive needing access reset urgently.

## Prevention and Best Practices

- **Awareness Training**: Regularly educate employees on identifying social engineering tactics.
- **Secure Disposal**: Shred or destroy documents and hardware before disposal.
- **Physical Security**: Use mantraps, badge scanners, and challenge unknown individuals.
- **Verification Protocols**: Confirm identities before sharing sensitive information.
- **Report Incidents**: Encourage employees to report suspicious behavior immediately.

## Summary

Social engineering relies on exploiting human trust rather than technical vulnerabilities. Prevention requires strong security culture, employee vigilance, and clearly enforced access controls.
