## What is a Threat Vector?

A **threat vector** is the path or method used by a threat actor to gain unauthorized access to a system or network. Understanding these vectors helps in developing effective security defenses.

## Common Threat Vectors

| Vector                    | Description |
|---------------------------|-------------|
| **Email**                 | Phishing, spear phishing, malicious attachments, or links used to trick users. |
| **Web**                   | Drive-by downloads, malicious ads, browser exploits, or infected websites. |
| **Removable Media**       | USB drives or external devices used to deliver malware or steal data. |
| **Wireless Networks**     | Man-in-the-middle attacks, rogue access points, or weak encryption. |
| **Social Engineering**    | Manipulating people to divulge confidential information (e.g., phone scams, pretexting). |
| **Supply Chain**          | Compromising third-party vendors or software used in your environment. |
| **Insider Threats**       | Employees or contractors with access who act maliciously or negligently. |
| **Cloud Services**        | Misconfigured cloud storage, poor access control, or compromised credentials. |
| **Mobile Devices**        | Unsecured apps, BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) risks, or lost/stolen devices. |
| **Software Vulnerabilities** | Exploiting unpatched software, zero-day attacks, or insecure code. |
| **Physical Access**       | Gaining access to facilities or devices to bypass digital defenses. |

## Social Engineering Tactics

| Tactic        | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| **Phishing**  | Generic fraudulent messages trying to trick users. |
| **Spear Phishing** | Targeted phishing tailored to a specific individual or organization. |
| **Whaling**   | Targeting high-profile individuals (executives, admins). |
| **Vishing**   | Voice-based phishing (e.g., phone calls pretending to be from IT support). |
| **Smishing**  | SMS-based phishing attacks. |

## Mitigation Strategies

- Employee training and awareness
- Email filtering and anti-phishing tools
- Regular software updates and patch management
- Strong access controls and network segmentation
- Endpoint protection and mobile device management (MDM)
- Monitor and audit supply chain partners

## Summary

Threat vectors are the routes attackers use to compromise systems. Recognizing and mitigating these vectors is critical to maintaining a secure environment.
