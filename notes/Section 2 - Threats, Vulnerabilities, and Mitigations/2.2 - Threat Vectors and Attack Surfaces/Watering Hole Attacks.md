# Watering Hole Attacks

## What is a Watering Hole Attack?

A **watering hole attack** is a targeted cyberattack in which the attacker compromises a website that is frequently visited by the victim’s group or organization. The goal is to infect the target’s system with malware when they visit the site.

---

## How It Works

1. **Research** – Attacker identifies websites commonly visited by the target group.
2. **Compromise** – The attacker exploits a vulnerability in one of those websites.
3. **Injection** – Malicious code (often JavaScript or malware) is injected into the site.
4. **Infection** – When a target visits the site, malware is downloaded and executed on their device.

## Characteristics

| Aspect                | Detail |
|------------------------|--------|
| **Targeted**           | Aimed at specific industries, companies, or user groups. |
| **Indirect Access**    | Doesn’t attack the victim directly—uses trusted third-party sites. |
| **Blended Attack**     | Often combined with zero-day vulnerabilities, drive-by downloads, or browser exploits. |
| **Hard to Detect**     | Victims believe they're visiting safe, familiar websites. |

## Real-World Example

- Attackers targeting government employees compromise a news site commonly read by them.
- Employees visit the site and unknowingly download spyware or a remote access tool (RAT).

---

## Prevention and Mitigation

- **Keep software updated**: Patch browsers, plugins, and OS regularly.
- **Web filtering**: Block access to known malicious or compromised sites.
- **Endpoint protection**: Use antivirus and endpoint detection & response (EDR) tools.
- **Least privilege**: Limit user access rights to minimize damage if compromised.
- **User awareness**: Educate users about potential risks and signs of infection.

## Summary

Watering hole attacks leverage trust in frequently visited websites to indirectly compromise specific targets. Staying secure requires layered defenses, vigilance, and proactive monitoring.
