# Hardening Techniques

---

System hardening is the process of securing a system by reducing its surface of vulnerability. This involves configuring systems, applications, and networks to minimize exposure to attacks.

## Key Hardening Techniques

| Technique                  | Description                                                                                     |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Remove Unnecessary Services** | Disable or uninstall services and software not needed for system function.                    |
| **Apply Security Patches** | Keep operating systems, applications, and firmware up to date with the latest security fixes.   |
| **Configure Firewalls**    | Implement host-based or network firewalls to restrict unwanted traffic.                         |
| **Use Strong Authentication** | Enforce complex passwords, multi-factor authentication, and account lockout policies.        |
| **Disable Default Accounts** | Remove or rename default accounts to prevent easy exploitation.                               |
| **Secure Configuration Baselines** | Use standardized secure configurations as templates for deployment.                       |
| **Limit User Privileges** | Apply the principle of least privilege to user accounts and applications.                      |
| **Encrypt Data**          | Protect sensitive data at rest and in transit with strong encryption.                          |
| **Audit and Monitor**     | Enable logging and monitor systems for suspicious activity.                                   |
| **Implement Application Whitelisting** | Only allow approved applications to run on the system.                              |
| **Disable Unused Ports**  | Close unused network ports to reduce entry points.                                            |
| **Physical Security**     | Protect hardware from unauthorized access or tampering.                                      |

## Hardening Network Devices

| Device Type            | Hardening Steps                                                            |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Routers and Switches** | Change default passwords, disable unused ports, use secure management protocols (SSH, SNMPv3). |
| **Firewalls**          | Define strict rules, disable unused features, and regularly update firmware. |

## Secure Configuration Baselines

- Use industry standards like **CIS Benchmarks** or **DISA STIGs**.
- Automate configuration checks with tools like **Ansible**, **Puppet**, or **Chef**.
- Regularly audit for configuration drift.

---

## Benefits of Hardening

- Reduces vulnerabilities and attack surface.
- Limits the potential impact of breaches.
- Improves compliance with security policies and regulations.

---

## Summary

- Hardening is a critical security process involving system and network configuration.
- Focus on minimizing services, enforcing strong authentication, patching, and monitoring.
- Use secure baselines and regularly audit systems for compliance.
