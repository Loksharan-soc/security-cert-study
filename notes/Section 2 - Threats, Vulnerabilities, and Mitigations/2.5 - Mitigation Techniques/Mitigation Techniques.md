# Mitigation Techniques

---

Mitigation techniques are strategies and controls implemented to reduce the risk, impact, or likelihood of security threats and vulnerabilities.

## Categories of Mitigation

| Category                  | Description                                                  |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Preventive Controls**   | Stop attacks before they happen (e.g., firewalls, encryption). |
| **Detective Controls**    | Identify attacks or incidents in progress (e.g., IDS, monitoring). |
| **Corrective Controls**   | Restore systems and data after an attack (e.g., backups, patches). |

## Common Mitigation Strategies

| Technique                  | Purpose / Description                                         |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Patch Management**       | Regularly apply updates to fix vulnerabilities.              |
| **Network Segmentation**   | Limit spread of attacks by isolating network zones.          |
| **Strong Authentication** | Use MFA and strong passwords to reduce unauthorized access.  |
| **Encryption**             | Protect data in transit and at rest from unauthorized access.|
| **Firewalls and IDS/IPS**  | Control and monitor network traffic to block malicious activity.|
| **User Training**          | Educate employees on recognizing phishing and social engineering.|
| **Access Control**         | Enforce least privilege and role-based access policies.      |
| **Backup and Recovery**    | Ensure data can be restored in case of ransomware or data loss.|

## Defense-in-Depth

- Implement multiple layers of security controls.
- No single control is foolproof, so combining them improves overall resilience.

## Example: Defending Against Phishing

| Step                     | Mitigation Technique                         |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Initial Email**        | Email filtering and spam detection            |
| **User Interaction**     | Security awareness training and simulated phishing tests |
| **Credential Protection**| Use MFA and strong password policies           |
| **Incident Response**    | Monitoring and rapid response to detected phishing |

## Best Practices for Mitigation

- Conduct regular vulnerability assessments and penetration tests.
- Automate patching and updates where possible.
- Monitor logs and network traffic continuously.
- Maintain an incident response plan.
- Use threat intelligence to stay ahead of new attack methods.

## Summary

- Mitigation reduces risk by preventing, detecting, or correcting threats.
- Layered defenses and ongoing management are critical.
- User awareness and technology controls must work together.
