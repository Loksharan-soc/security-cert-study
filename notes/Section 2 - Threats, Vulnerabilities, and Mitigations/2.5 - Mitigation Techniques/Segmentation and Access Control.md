# Segmentation and Access Control

---

Segmentation and access control are critical components of network security, helping to reduce the attack surface, limit lateral movement, and ensure that users and systems only access what theyâ€™re authorized to.

## Network Segmentation

**Definition**: Dividing a network into smaller subnetworks (segments) to improve performance and security.

### Benefits:
- **Limits attack scope**: Compromise in one segment doesn't give access to the whole network.
- **Improves traffic management**: Reduces congestion and increases visibility.
- **Enhances containment**: Threats or malware are isolated to a single segment.

### Types of Segmentation:

| Type                  | Description                                         |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **Physical**          | Uses separate hardware (e.g., different switches). |
| **Logical (VLANs)**   | Uses virtual LANs to segment traffic logically.     |
| **Software-defined**  | Implemented via policies in SDN environments.       |
| **Microsegmentation** | Fine-grained segmentation at workload/application level. |

## Access Control

**Definition**: Restricting access to systems, data, or network resources based on policies.

### Access Control Models:

| Model                   | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **MAC (Mandatory)**     | Access based on classification levels (e.g., top secret).                   |
| **DAC (Discretionary)** | Owners decide who has access to their resources.                            |
| **RBAC (Role-Based)**   | Access based on user roles within an organization.                          |
| **ABAC (Attribute-Based)** | Access based on attributes like department, time of day, location.     |

## Principles of Access Control

- **Least Privilege**: Users get the minimum access necessary for their job.
- **Need to Know**: Access only to information required to perform tasks.
- **Separation of Duties**: No single user has control over all aspects of a process.
- **Implicit Deny**: Access is denied unless explicitly granted.

## Access Control Techniques

| Technique            | Description                                                  |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **ACLs (Access Control Lists)** | Rules applied to network devices to filter traffic.         |
| **Firewalls**         | Enforce policies on inbound/outbound traffic.               |
| **Authentication Systems** | Verify identity before granting access.               |
| **Multifactor Authentication (MFA)** | Adds layers to authentication.               |
| **Single Sign-On (SSO)** | Allows access to multiple resources with one login.       |

## Combining Segmentation and Access Control

- **Network ACLs on Segments**: Block unauthorized traffic between zones.
- **User Roles in Segments**: Control what each user can access within a segment.
- **Segmentation + MFA**: Limits access even if credentials are stolen.
- **Microsegmentation + Identity**: Enforces access at the user/workload level.

---

## Summary

- Segmentation isolates network components to limit breaches.
- Access control ensures only authorized users can access sensitive resources.
- Together, they create layered, defense-in-depth protection.
